No privacy information is collected from the application at any time. 
It would be a complete abomination for any app trying to protect its users to do so.
Only the selections and keys entered into the app fields are recorded into the keychain metadata 
to generate secure one way hashes as selected and requested of the user, and those are removed once the entry itself is removed.
